# Dev Environment Setup

Once Startup/Install processes have been setup to configure:
- host
- vbox for cross-compilation
- bbb

These scripts may be used to automatically setup a development environment using tmux and a set of bash aliases designed to streamline building the question list manager and uploading it to a bbb connected via ethernet over usb.
